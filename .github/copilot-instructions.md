2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution expectations and coding style.
3. `docs/math_and_solver.md` for the governing equations and discretisation details.
4. `docs/dev_environment.md` for build, test, and debugging workflows (including VS Code tasks).
5. `docs/solver_performance.md` for runtime heuristics and benchmarking guidance.
