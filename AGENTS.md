# Agent Onboarding Notes

Start by reviewing the existing documentation before making changes:

- **Project overview:** `README.md`
- **Contribution rules and coding standards:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Physics and solver details:** `docs/math_and_solver.md`
- **Developer workflow tips (CLI, VS Code, Codespaces):** `docs/dev_environment.md`
- **Performance guidance and benchmarking workflow:** `docs/solver_performance.md`
- **Visualization helper:** `python/visualize_wire.py`

Check for additional nested `AGENTS.md` files in subdirectories when you work within them.
