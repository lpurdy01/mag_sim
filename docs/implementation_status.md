# Next-Stage Plan Implementation Status

This document tracks progress against the "Next-Stage Development Plan â€” Time Series, Forces, and Advanced Probes" roadmap.

## Completed Milestones
- **VTK export and verification**: Implemented via `motorsim::write_vti_field_map` and the `python/verify_vtk.py` utility; documentation lives in `docs/vtk_output.md`.
- **Time-series infrastructure**: Scenario timelines, per-frame solving, and parallel execution are available and covered in `docs/time_series.md`.
- **Maxwell stress probes**: Force/torque evaluation and documentation reside in `docs/torque_forces.md`.
- **Back-EMF probes**: Flux integration across timeline frames emits per-interval voltages and is covered in `docs/back_emf.md`.
- **Visualization upgrades**: `python/visualize_scenario_field.py` exposes log-scale colormaps, boundary overlays, streamline controls, analytic overlays, and vector scaling modes as described in the roadmap.

## Next Steps
- The staged validation ladder is now in place; future research tasks can build atop the documented scenarios.
