# Field Visualisation Options

The `python/visualize_scenario_field.py` helper renders solver field maps with a
number of switches that mirror the "Visualization Upgrades" milestone from the
roadmap.

## Command-line summary

```
python3 python/visualize_scenario_field.py \
  --scenario inputs/two_wire_cancel.json \
  --field-map outputs/two_wire_field_map.csv \
  --draw-boundaries \
  --streamlines \
  --overlay-analytic interface \
  --vector-mode log \
  --vector-log-floor 1e-6 \
  --color-scale log \
  --log-floor 1e-6
```

Key options:

- `--color-scale {linear,log}` toggles between a linear palette and logarithmic
  magnitude scaling. Pair with `--log-floor` to bound the minimum |B| value.
- `--draw-boundaries` outlines material and magnet regions extracted from the
  scenario JSON so discontinuities are easy to spot.
- `--outline-vtp PATH` overlays solver-generated geometry outlines (domain,
  rotor assemblies, magnets, wires). When supplied, the helper automatically
  searches for the neighbouring `_labels.csv` metadata file so loop/group names
  can be joined in ParaView.
- `--streamlines` overlays streamlines traced from the field grid.
- `--vector-mode {linear,log,off}` controls the quiver arrows. The `log` mode
  compresses dynamic range using a log-normalised magnitude, while `off`
  disables the overlay entirely. `--vector-log-floor` mirrors `--log-floor` for
  the quiver transform.
- `--overlay-analytic interface` draws contour lines for the planar permeability
  interface analytic reference when available. Additional overlays can be added
  under the same flag in the future.
- `--save PATH` writes the rendered figure to disk; otherwise the viewer window
  opens interactively.

## CI integration

`scripts/run_ci_checks.sh` exercises these switches for the canonical demo
scenarios so GitHub Actions artifacts include the enhanced renders. The iron ring
and magnet strip plots use `--color-scale log` together with `--vector-mode log`
to improve readability when the dynamic range spans several orders of
magnitude, and the rotor ripple frames feed their per-frame `_outlines.vtp`
files back into the renderer via `--outline-vtp` so the rotating rotor geometry
is visible in the PNGs.

## ParaView overlays

When loading solver outputs directly in ParaView, open both the `.vti` field
map and its `*_outlines.vtp` companion. The outline file carries cell data for
the `kind` category and a `loop_index`, while the neighbouring
`*_outlines_labels.csv` file provides the index-to-label mapping along with any
rotor/stator group annotations. Join the CSV in the Spreadsheet view or an
external tool to colour or filter geometry independently of the field. Select
the `B` or `H` vector arrays for glyphs or
streamlinesâ€”the data are already packaged as three-component vectors, so no
calculator filters are required.
