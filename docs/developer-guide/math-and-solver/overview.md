# Math & Solver Overview

These notes summarise the magnetostatic formulation, discretisation, and timeline features used by the solver. Start with [Fundamentals](fundamentals.md) for governing equations, then continue to [Back EMF](back-emf.md) and [Time-Series](time-series.md) for specialised workflows. Reusable equations and symbol tables live under [Reference â†’ Equations](../../reference/equations/index.md).
