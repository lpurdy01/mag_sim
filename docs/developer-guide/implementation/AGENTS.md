# Implementation Progress Docs Notes

- This folder hosts running logs that track implementation efforts for major
  epics (solver, GUI, etc.). Keep entries factual and date-agnostic so the
  narrative remains evergreen.
- When you land new capabilities, add concise bullets under the relevant
  sections rather than rewriting history; older entries provide context for
  future contributors.
- If you introduce a new epic, create a sibling progress file and reference it
  from the MkDocs navigation (`mkdocs.yml`).
- Tests or code changes that the documentation references should be cited with
  file paths or module names where possible.
- Avoid embedding binary artefacts or screenshots hereâ€”link to reproducible
  commands or test cases instead.
