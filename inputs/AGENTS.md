# Inputs directory guide

- Scenario JSON files under this tree are treated as source artefacts. Keep
  values human-readable and add comments in adjacent documentation rather than
  embedding pseudo-comments in the JSON.
- Avoid committing solver outputs (CSV, PNG, etc.) hereâ€”runtime artefacts belong
  under `outputs/` or the CI artifact bundle.
- When tests depend on a scenario, store it inside `inputs/tests/` so the C++
  regression harness and the JSON fixture stay in sync.
